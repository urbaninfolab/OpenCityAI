[OpenCityAI](https://opencityai.com/about) is a state-of-the-art AI chatbot trained on a massive amount of public city information, making it able to generate answers for a variety of questions that people may have about their cities. It provides accurate responses with citations in a simple easy-to-use interface. OpenCityAI was developed with a focus on accuracy, and has been shown to perform with almost 10x the ability at answering city-based data questions as compared to current AI solutions. This project bridges the gap of being able to find specific information about a city, and allows anyone to access accurate information about any city immediately. 

_Note: As AI is a developing technology, OpenCityAI may occasionally generate incorrect or outdated information. The Urban Information Lab is committed to remedying these issues, and encourages you to [reach out](mailto:support@opencityai.com?subject=Bug%20Report&amp;body=Please%20describe%20the%20bug%20here.) if you find any instances of this._

# Getting Started with OpenCityAI

The website offers an [accessible, conversational front-end](https://opencityai.com):

An example to find out how many answered calls there were in Austin for Law Enforcement in 2019 would be:

OpenCityAI is optimized for questions that can be answered with open city data, such as this one.
Once you submit your question, the AI will generate its response with a matching citation.

For organizational purposes, OpenCityAI allows you to create and manage multiple conversations which you can rename to whatever suits you.
